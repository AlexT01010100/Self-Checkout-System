Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing the backend components of a self checkout system using the state pattern in an object-oriented design, without employing any conditionals. The backend handles core functionalities such as item scanning, calculating totals, and processing payments in a retail environment. By utilizing the state pattern, the system achieves flexibility and extensibility in managing different states of the checkout process.

Project Objectives:

State Pattern Implementation - The primary objective is to design and implement the backend of the self checkout system using the state pattern to manage different states of the checkout process without resorting to conditionals.

Learning Outcomes:

Design Patterns - Gain proficiency in applying the state pattern to model complex state transitions in the backend of the self checkout system, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

Object-Oriented Principles - Reinforce understanding of object-oriented principles such as inheritance, and polymorphism in practical software development, particularly in the context of backend systems.

Software Architecture - Explore the benefits of using design patterns and object-oriented principles to create flexible and scalable backend architectures, ensuring the robustness and efficiency of the self checkout system.

Project Significance:

This project serves as a foundational step in building the self checkout system, laying the groundwork for the integration of frontend components and the deployment of a complete solution. By focusing on the backend, the project demonstrates the importance of well-designed backend architectures in enabling seamless frontend interactions and ensuring the overall functionality and reliability of the system.

Conclusion:

The backend development of the self checkout system project showcases the application of advanced software engineering concepts, particularly in the realm of backend architecture and design patterns. By leveraging the state pattern and adhering to object-oriented principles, the backend achieves modularity, extensibility, and maintainability, paving the way for the successful implementation of the complete self checkout system.
